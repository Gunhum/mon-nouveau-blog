# Tennis Club Booking Simulator

Small web application developed to simulate tennis court reservations for a club.

This project was originally created as a learning and experimentation project to understand how a full web application works, from backend to frontend.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Simulate the reservation of tennis courts
- Explore how a backend (Django) communicates with a frontend (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
- Understand the basics of web applications: routing, forms, and simple data handling

This is not a production system, but a technical learning project.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (Django)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite (default Django setup)

## ⚙️ Features

- Simulated booking of tennis courts
- Simple web interface to enter reservation information
- Backend logic to process and store bookings

## ▶️ How to run locally
